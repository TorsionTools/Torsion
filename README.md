Autodesk Revit 2024+ API Visual Studio Solution Template with Code Examples for Common Tools

The intent of the repository is to help provide REVIT API support, share code examples, and share solutions for common time consuming tasks in Revit. 

I will provide examples and tools I have created and use. Others are free to manipulate them to suite their needs, but without any expressed or implied warranty and/or guarantee of functionality or errors.

I think this will be the best way to share some of the work I have done without having to create installers for every single tool or publishing everything to the Autodesk App Store.
